1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
- Both functions are used to execute Javascript code asynchronously. But the main difference between the two is scheduling behavior.
- `setImmediate` schedules the callback function to be executed immediately after the current iteration of the event loop.
- `setTimeout` schedules the callback function to be executed after a minimum delay.
- The `setImmediate` has higher priority than `setTimeout`.


2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
- Both functions are used to execute Javascript code asynchronously. But the main difference between the two is scheduling behavior and priorities.
- `process.nextTick` schedules a callback function to be executed at the earliest opportunity, just before the next iteration of the event loop.
- `setImmediate` schedules the callback function to be executed immediately after the current iteration of the event loop.


3. Does Node.js has window object?
- Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that runs outside of a web browser environment, and it does not provide a window object.
